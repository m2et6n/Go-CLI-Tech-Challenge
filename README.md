# Go Tech Challenge: File System CLI

## Overview

This challenge is designed to allow the developer to become familiar with the basic concepts of Golang and creating a command line interface (CLI) tool in Golang.

The challenge consists of two parts. In part 1, developers will handle the technical setup required to complete the challenge. This will include a walkthrough for installing Golang and creating a go module for the Tech Challenge. After completing the technical setup, developers can then move on to part 2, which will entail a detailed walkthrough on implementing one of the command line tools for the challenge, utilizing idiomatic go practices to write effective go code. Part 2 will also briefly cover unit testing patterns like table-driven tests. By the end of part 2, developers should be able to complete the challenge with no further assistance. Lastly, part 3 covers the requirements to complete the challenge, along with the rubric that will be used for grading.

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to install and configure Golang for local development
- Develop a familiarity with the basics of Golang: Using the Standard Library, Command-Line Arguments, Interfaces
- Develop a familiarity with the basics of testing in Golang: Table-Driven Testing, Mocking
